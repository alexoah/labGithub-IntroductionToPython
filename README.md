# Let's Write a Python Quote Bot!

This repository will get you started with building a quote bot in Python. It's meant to be used along with the [Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com) intro to Python.

When complete, you'll be able to grab random quotes from the command line, like this:

> **$** python get-quote.py
> 
> Keep it logically awesome
> 
> **$** python get-quote.py
> 
> Speak like a human

## Start the Tutorial

You can find your next step in [this repo's issues](../../issues/)!

## Just FYI
This is a file-based quote bot written in Python from https://lab.github.com/everydeveloper/introduction-to-python
